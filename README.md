# Predicting temperature data 
In this project we try to predict the temperature data in India at few locations for two cases:-
## 1) 1D model :-
In this case we predict temperature at a single spatial point at different times. We compare the predictions using FNO, CNN and LSTM models. You can find code for the same in the 1D_models folder

## 2) 3D model :-
In this case we predict temperature at a given time step over a grid spanning in latitude, longitude and altitude.

# About the data
The data is in ".nc" file format, you can check **this video**( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=699jkjLJGyM ) to learn about it.

# Running the files
You will need to install the dependencies and change the variables storing file path in the codes to run it.
